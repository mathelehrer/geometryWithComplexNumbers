The repo contains the scripts and some selected blender files for the video

Solving Olympiad Level Geometry Problems with Complex Numbers

The bender files are generated automatically by a python library.
The script for the generation of the blender file is included in the folder script. It contains about 10000 lines of code. It only runs with a homemade library. It will be published eventually, but for now it is at a highly experimental stage. If you are nevertheless interested, just get in touch with me.
